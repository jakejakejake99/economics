## interactive model: relative demand for skilled labor

this notebook visualizes how the relative demand for high-skilled vs low-skilled labor (H/L) changes with respect to:
- δ: importance of skilled labor in production
- ρ: elasticity of substitution between labor types
- w_H, w_L: wages of skilled and unskilled labor
- φ: productivity shifter favoring unskilled labor

it uses a CES labor demand function and ipywidgets for interactive exploration.

> inspired by models of skill-biased technical change and CES production functions in labor economics
