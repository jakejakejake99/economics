# cournot competition interactive app

this repository contains a python script that implements an interactive application to visualize models of industrial competition. the app allows you to explore different scenarios, including:

- cournot equilibrium (where both firms choose output simultaneously)
- stackelberg competition (where one firm leads and the other follows)

additionally, the app displays iso-profit contours and a shaded region labeled "potential gains from cooperation". this region illustrates how both firms could achieve higher profits than the cournot outcome if they cooperated, even though this is only a pedagogical tool and not an implementation of a full collusion model.
