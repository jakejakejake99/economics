# COURNOT COMPETITION INTERACTIVE APP

THIS REPOSITORY CONTAINS A PYTHON SCRIPT THAT IMPLEMENTS AN INTERACTIVE APPLICATION TO VISUALIZE MODELS OF INDUSTRIAL COMPETITION. THE APP ALLOWS YOU TO EXPLORE DIFFERENT SCENARIOS, INCLUDING:

- **COURNOT EQUILIBRIUM** (WHERE BOTH FIRMS CHOOSE OUTPUT SIMULTANEOUSLY)
- **STACKELBERG COMPETITION** (WHERE ONE FIRM LEADS AND THE OTHER FOLLOWS)

ADDITIONALLY, THE APP DISPLAYS ISO-PROFIT CONTOURS AND A SHADED REGION LABELED **"POTENTIAL GAINS FROM COOPERATION"**. THIS REGION ILLUSTRATES HOW BOTH FIRMS COULD ACHIEVE HIGHER PROFITS THAN THE COURNOT OUTCOME IF THEY COOPERATED, EVEN THOUGH THIS IS ONLY A PEDAGOGICAL TOOL AND NOT AN IMPLEMENTATION OF A FULL COLLUSION MODEL.
